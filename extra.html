            <p class="para">We work with students of classes IX, X, XI and XII to help plan for their higher
                studies. It has been our observation that most students and parents find this process scary, highly
                confusing and extremely challenging. Our aim is to help them through this difficult phase of their
                journey towards a successful college and career. Our programmes are designed specifically for this
                purpose.Parents and students are not able to keep up with these ever evolving dynamics between
                Education, Employment and Industry. Many of the jobs which are the highest paying in their
                respective fields today did not exist 10 years ago. We help students make sense of these scenarios
                and enable them to make better decisions about their futures.</p>
